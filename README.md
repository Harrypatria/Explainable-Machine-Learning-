### Explainable Machine Learning

### Diabetes Dataset
Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Samples total: 442
Dimensionality: 10
Features: real, -.2 < x < .2
age age in years
sex
bmi body mass index
bp average blood pressure
s1 tc, T-Cells (a type of white blood cells)
s2 ldl, low-density lipoproteins
s3 hdl, high-density lipoproteins
s4 tch, thyroid stimulating hormone
s5 ltg, lamotrigine
s6 glu, blood sugar level
Targets: integer 25 - 346
Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times n_samples (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1).
